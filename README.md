# kicad-spice

KiCAD uses ngspice as simulation software with a very kind GUI.

ngspice itself inherits xspice, which allows you digital simulation as well analog-mixed signal simulations.

In addition xspice allows the user to generate their own C-based models. Cool feature.

This repository is my "kickstarter" to provide KiCAD symbols to the exisiting xspice models.

If the library is complete (if ever I have time for it), this enables the user to draw complex schematics in KiCAD and simulate them.

We are ongoing to integrate "real" exisiting parts with footprints as well, so KiCAD schematics are simulateable and also layoutable.

Let's do it.

Please do not forget to make a entry in "Configure Paths" in Preferences menu:
KICAD_SPICE_DIR  pointts f.e. to C:\KiCad\kicad-spice

PS: I do this for free .. if anybody wants to contribute or has idead for optimizations .. you are welcome ;-)
